# FQQDBot
Official FQQDBot Repo

This is the code for my FQQDBot, which can be found on http://dc.fqqd.de/

It's incredibly ugly and partly german and I'm neither gonna help anyone get this running or fix errors, lmao

But, you do need
- Disnake & discord_webhooks
- Bot User, Webhooks for news and rules
- token.txt with token
- rules.txt with server rules
- warnings folder
- and other stuff, youll figure it out
